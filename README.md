This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Environment Setup

Install Postgress Locally: https://postgresapp.com/downloads.html

Install Postico 2: https://eggerapps.at/postico2/

Create and populate `.env.development` and `.env.production` files in the root of the directory

`npm install`

Open Postgres and create a database called `pharmabox`

Open Postico2 and connect to this server.

Create the database schema with: `sh bash/migrate_dbs`

Populate database with fake data with: `sh bash/seed_test_dbs`

Startup Server and Frontend with `npm run dev`

View Frontend on `http://localhost:3000`

You should also be able to view the populated data in the user's table in Postico2

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
